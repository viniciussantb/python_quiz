 Quiz game in python
 
 About the application:
 
 -This application was made using python, with "User Datagram Protocol" (UDP) to sending the packets for the server.
 
 How to Run:
 
 -First the machine that will be the server needs to verify your IP, and send it to the other three players. After that, the server needs to replace the 'localhost' in 'server address' in the code with the verified IP. So the players must do the same change in the 'server address' in their code, still using the server's IP. Now it's right to go :)
